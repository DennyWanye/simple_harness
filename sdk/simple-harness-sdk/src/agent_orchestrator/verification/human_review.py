"""Human review — the sixth verification layer (original §14.1 "必要时人工审核", §24
NEEDS_HUMAN; ORCH §9.2 human_review row "把 NEEDS_HUMAN 和 Verifier 冲突送人工"; plan D7-8').

A person is asked when the Task's policy names ``human_review`` or when the Critic cannot
reliably judge (``needs_human``, original §22 "模型无法可靠判断成功条件").  The layer never
short-circuits the others: the code tests still run first, and a person's PASS never
covers a failing layer.  While nobody has answered, the result is SUSPENDED.

A Verifier conflict also goes to a person, as arbitration (this build's two kinds, plan
D7-8'): a step-4 Conflict Task that could not settle a contradiction, and a Mission-level
judge Critic that finds a criterion unmet although every deterministic criterion is met
and the Tasks' own Critics passed."""
