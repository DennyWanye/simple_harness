"""Structural checks on a compiled execution projection (TG §14.2–14.3, §24.1/10–11).

Only the *execution projection* is checked for cycles.  The other readings of the
same network answer different questions and are deliberately not merged into one
``DiGraph`` for a single ``is_acyclic`` call (TG §5):

======================================  ==================================================
method definition graph                 may recurse; bounded expansion is checked elsewhere
instantiated refinement relations       :func:`validate_refinement_acyclic` — no occurrence
                                        may be its own ancestor, checked per *configuration*
adopted execution projection            :func:`validate_execution_projection` — must be a DAG
evidence support graph                  anchor-free SCCs, checked by the knowledge layer
supersedes / event history              causal order, never execution order
live resource wait-for graph            deadlock analysis, not a Task DAG property
======================================  ==================================================

Each class of problem is reported on its own: a caller that wants to know whether
the ports are bound must not have to infer it from a single boolean that also
covered cycles and coverage.  Size limits are reported as ``BOUND_REACHED`` — the
projection is never silently truncated to fit, and a report that had to stop
listing says so with a ``BOUND_REACHED`` of its own.

The topological sort is a heap-based Kahn over an explicit ``nodes + adjacency +
indegree``.  Ties break on the immutable node ordinal, which exists for
determinism and carries no business meaning.  ``graphlib.TopologicalSorter`` is a
fine cross-check on a frozen snapshot and is used as one in the tests; it is not
used here, because its ``prepare`` closes the graph and it silently invents nodes
it has not been given.
