"""P2.3a: one plan revision is committed atomically, or not at all (§9.4, TG §7.4).

This is the ninth Commit Service mixin and the single writing entry point of the
hierarchical mode.  Everything it does is arranged around one sentence of ADR-13:

    the integer ``base_graph_version`` stays the coarse concurrency gate for every
    Mission; a hierarchical proposal carries a *semantic* read-set beside it, which
    is checked item by item afterwards, and any stale item refuses the commit — with
    no automatic rebase.

So the order below is not cosmetic.  The integer gate runs first because it is the
cheap answer that every Mission already agrees on; the read-set runs second because
it is the expensive one and only hierarchical Missions have it; and the automatic
``allow_rebase`` replay of :meth:`CommitService.commit_graph_change` is deliberately
*not* reachable from here (C19): a proposal whose read went stale is handed back to
its author to recompile against the new snapshot, because replaying it would mean
deciding, on the author's behalf, that a fact it read did not matter.

Three further boundaries the plan states and this module keeps:

* **Legacy Missions stop at the door.**  A Mission whose
  ``orchestration_semantics_version`` is not ``hierarchical`` is refused after the
  ``missions`` row is read and before any migration-16 table is touched — no read,
  no write, no event (§18.5 rule 1).
* **No raw SQL, ever.**  Every row goes through :class:`HtnStore` /
  :class:`ObligationStore`, which stay the single writing authority for the new
  tables.  This module decides *whether*; storage decides *how*.
* **Nothing slow runs inside the transaction.**  No model, no solver, no tool.  The
  structural re-validation is pure computation over the snapshot the caller
  compiled plus the delta, which is the "check certificate, re-confirmed under the
  structural version" TG §7.4 asks for.

The command is refused with a named reason, never with a boolean: a stale read-set,
a cycle, an exhausted allowance and unreconciled running work are four different
repairs, and collapsing them would tell the proposer nothing about what to do next.

        The rules, in the order they matter:

        1. **A row that already exists is reused, never rewritten.**  An occurrence
           keeps its Task across revisions (the occurrence id *is* the task id in the
           compiled network), and rewriting the row would throw away its attempts,
           its accepted artefacts and its budget history — the very facts §9.4's
           running-work reconciliation is about.  ``_revoke_running_work`` has
           already withdrawn the execution right of anything this delta replaces.
        2. **Every form gets a row; only a primitive gets a dispatchable one.**  See
           :mod:`.occurrence_tasks` — a compound row is BLOCKED and is refused by the
           form gate at three independent places.
        3. **The budget is a share of what the Mission's task pool still has.**
           ``open_account`` refuses limits that do not fit the parent, so a share is
           computed rather than guessed, and every other dimension is inherited from
           the Mission.  The dividend is the pool *minus what the existing rows
           already hold* and the divisor counts the compounds nobody has refined yet,
           so a later refinement round is still payable — see
           :func:`.occurrence_tasks.share_tokens`.  A share that does not fit, or a
           pool that cannot pay for the new primitives at all, is a refusal
           (``BUDGET_INSUFFICIENT``), never a row with an account nobody can draw on.
