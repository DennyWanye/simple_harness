"""WI-B1 — SessionGoalStore（PRD Stage B § B1）.

In-memory store mapping ``session_id -> SessionGoal``. Used by
``/goal <text>`` slash command and consumed by ``AgentLoop`` end-turn
``goal_checker`` rebound (see ``goal_checker.py``).

Persistence is deliberately NOT implemented in v1 — goals are
session-lifetime only (TODO: SessionDB persistence留 v2). Re-setting
the same ``session_id`` overwrites the prior goal (last-write-wins).

Thread-safety: protected by a single ``asyncio.Lock``? No — the store
is consumed from a single asyncio task per session (AgentLoop runs
sequentially per WS connection), so a plain ``dict`` is sufficient.
If callers spawn parallel coros per session, wrap the store in a lock
at the call site.

    done:
