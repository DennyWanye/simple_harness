"""P2.3c part 2b: a verified primitive leaf → an ``Acceptance`` → the output index.

Part 2 built ``accept_review`` and part 2's §13 listed what was missing around it:
nothing in ``src`` turned a *verified result* into the AER anchors the command
quotes, so ``acceptance_outputs`` was never written and ``_recorded_outputs`` still
had nothing to read.  This module is that bridge, and it is deliberately a **bridge
and not a decision**: every value it writes is read off something that already
happened.

Where each anchor comes from — the point being that none of them is invented here:

``RequirementsRevision``
    the leaf's own goal signature plus the root criteria the adopted method's
    ``criterion_links`` hang on this occurrence (P2.3h, :func:`criteria_for`).  Its
    ``coverage_criteria`` are what the plan says this occurrence has to cover; the
    *required checks* of each criterion are the verification layers that actually
    ran on this result.  A criterion nobody can check is therefore not silently
    satisfied — it is a criterion with no gate, and the acceptance formula treats it
    as such.  A root criterion the plan did **not** link to this leaf is absent from
    its package, never PASS.
``ReviewPackage`` / ``ReviewRecord``
    frozen from the verification verdict and **stored before the command**, because
    ``accept_review`` re-reads both from the store and compares content hashes: an
    anchor supplied with the command is exactly what an immutable anchor is not.
``CriterionOutcome.evidence_refs``
    one ``TOOL_RECEIPT`` per layer that ran, attributed ``Provenance.TOOL`` by *this*
    side.  A model may only ever claim ``model``/``human`` for itself, so the
    attribution written here is the signal ``receipt_source`` is allowed to trust —
    and it is written only for layers the router really recorded.
``ValidityWitness``
    a fresh ``purpose=ACCEPT`` witness for this task, at the scope's current epoch.
    A ``START`` witness that licensed the dispatch does not license the acceptance.
``AcceptedOutput``
    the artifacts this result produced, filed under the ports the **plan** declares
    for this occurrence.  Where the plan declares no port, nothing is indexed: a leaf
    whose result no occurrence consumes feeds nothing, and an entry for it would be
    the all-ancestors sweep §24.1 decision 4 removed.

Two things this module refuses to do:

* **It never manufactures a PASS.**  :func:`outcomes_for` reports what each layer
  reported; a layer that errored or failed becomes a non-PASS outcome and the
  acceptance formula refuses.  A caller that only calls this on a passed verdict is
  not relying on that, and a caller that calls it on a failed one gets a refusal
  rather than an acceptance.
* **It never accepts a compound.**  A compound goal is satisfied by
  ``commit_goal_resolution`` out of its children's acceptances, never by a review of
  its own (§6.3).
