From the Mission's final products — the integrated tree the judgment used, i.e. every
completed Task's accepted artifacts merged along the dependency chain — to the Task,
Attempt, Agent, role, model and prompt version that produced them, the verification
layers that let them through, the knowledge path (``lineage``) and the actions and
people on the way.  Everything that did not reach the success path is listed as
exploration spending with its reason, and the Mission's imported usage is split row by
row into path / exploration / services with an "unclassified" bucket that must stay
empty.  A record that is missing is reported as a break — never bridged."""
