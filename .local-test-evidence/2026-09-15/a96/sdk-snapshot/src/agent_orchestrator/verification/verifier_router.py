"""Verifier Router (§14.1, ORCH §12.4, plan D9/D23).

The Task Contract's ``verification_policy`` names the layers that *must* run.
Layers are recorded in the §14.1 order (format → rule → critic → test); the first required
layer that FAILs or ERRORs short-circuits the rest (D23).  Layers the policy did
not request are recorded as ``NOT_REQUIRED`` — never as PASS.  A layer that was
requested but could not run (e.g. the Critic's verdict was unreadable) is
``ERROR`` and blocks acceptance exactly like a FAIL: "未运行的必需层不能算 PASS".

The Critic layer is executed by a callback supplied by the orchestrator (it needs
a dispatch intent, budget and the Agent bridge); everything else is local.
When both Critic and code_test are required, code_test executes after the deterministic
gates and before Critic so its independent output can be reviewed. Its result is
recorded at the existing code_test position.
