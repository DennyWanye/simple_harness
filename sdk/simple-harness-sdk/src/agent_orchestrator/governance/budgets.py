"""Budget accounts, Reserve / Settle and usage import (§18, ORCH-BUILD §12.2).

Two layers, never mixed:

* **Allocation layer** (this module): ``budget_accounts`` for Mission → Task →
  Attempt, ``budget_reservations`` per dispatch subject.  Reserve before an
  Attempt starts (§18.3), Settle with the real cost afterwards, release what was
  not used.  Child limits never exceed the parent (§18.2) and a child allocation
  never *adds* funds.
* **Fact layer** (the SDK ``provider_invocations`` ledger): the only source of
  actual token / money figures.  ``import_usage`` copies each ``usage_ref`` at
  most once (``imported_usage`` PK).  In ``unpriced`` mode the money column stays
  ``NULL`` and the settlement is flagged ``unpriced`` — never written as zero.

An UNKNOWN provider call keeps its reservation occupied: ``settle`` refuses to
run until the caller says every usage ref is final.
