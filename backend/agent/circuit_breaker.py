"""P5-S2 Phase 3.1: per-(session, tool) circuit breaker.

Spec: ``openspec/changes/p5-s2-self-healing-harness/specs/tool-registry/circuit-breaker.md``

Three-state machine guards each ``(session_id, tool_name)`` pair so a
runaway LLM that keeps retrying the same broken tool stops costing wall
time and tokens after the third failure.

States::

    CLOSED      ── 3 failures ──▶  OPEN
    OPEN        ── cooldown   ──▶  HALF_OPEN  (allows ONE probe)
    HALF_OPEN   ── success    ──▶  CLOSED
    HALF_OPEN   ── failure    ──▶  OPEN  (cooldown timer resets)

The breaker stores no per-call data; it just owns the small state record
keyed by (sid, tool). Time is injected via ``clock`` for determinism in
tests. ``asyncio.Lock`` protects every transition because the dispatch
path and the watchdog scan loop run on different async tasks.

Why we don't use a library: this is ~80 lines, the corner cases (probe
in flight, cooldown reset on probe failure, per-tuple isolation) are
project-specific, and depending on a 3rd-party breaker would import
threading semantics that don't compose with the agent loop's asyncio
model.
