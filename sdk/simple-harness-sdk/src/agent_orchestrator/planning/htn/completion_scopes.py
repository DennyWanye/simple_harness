"""Pure compilation of approved completion requirements into plan scopes.

``approved_criterion_coverage`` is not an approval flag.  Its entries must be the
real :class:`CarriedCriterion` values resolved from admitted Method contracts (and,
optionally, their persisted :class:`ObligationCoverage` projection).  The caller is
responsible for obtaining those values through the registry-backed plan compiler;
this function rejects mappings and booleans rather than accepting an assertion of
authority.

The current contracts contain no approved ``effect_key -> child occurrence`` field.
Consequently effects stay owned by the unique root of their Obligation.  A future
explicit owner mapping belongs in the approved Method/Task contract, not here as a
heuristic over operator names, prose, capabilities, or side-effect kinds.
