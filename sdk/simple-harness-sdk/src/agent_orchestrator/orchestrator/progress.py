"""FAST / WAIT / SLOW / STOP progress routes (NEXT-TG-1.0 §3).

A pure mapping from facts the loop already trusts to a route and a named reason.
It opens no store, calls no model, writes nothing and grants nothing: the loop
gathers the facts, and every Commit and hand-off downstream re-checks the world.

The first consumer is the idle path. Before it, the stall record and the stall
confirmation each carried their own list of "this is a legal wait", and the lists
had drifted apart: the record did not know a judged Mission waiting for its
closeout (real run 2026-09-28, mission-e5f82ae8c9f24ff8), and neither knew an
UNKNOWN action under reconciliation or a person's pending approval, which §3.5
routes to WAIT. Both now ask :func:`idle_verdict`.
