"""P2.3c: ``accept_review`` and ``commit_goal_resolution`` (AER §6–§7, §25.1 decision 4).

AER §6.1 keeps four facts apart and §25.1 decision 4 keeps two *actions* apart:
accepting one contribution and declaring a goal satisfied are not the same write,
do not share a receipt, and do not imply one another.  This module is therefore
two entry points rather than one with a flag:

``accept_review``
    a Commit accepted **one contribution** under stated requirements, inputs,
    artefacts, review identity and support.  It writes an
    :class:`~..contracts.resolution.Acceptance` and touches no duty lifecycle:
    accepting a report is not declaring the goal done, and it is not authorising
    an action either (invariants I01 / I03).
``commit_goal_resolution``
    a Task / Obligation is satisfied **as a whole**.  For a compound that means a
    legal adopted method, a valid ``Acceptance`` for every *required* child
    occurrence, the composition obligation, and coverage of every required root
    criterion; for a Mission root it additionally means the delivery contract was
    actually reached.  Only then is a
    :class:`~..contracts.resolution.GoalResolution` written and the duty moved to
    ``SATISFIED`` with its ``resolution_ref``.

Three refusals this module exists to make impossible to bypass:

* **"wrongly declared complete" = 0.**  A Mission root ``GoalResolution`` is formed
  here and nowhere else, and it is formed from the *success formula plus the final
  acceptance* — never from "the last topological leaf finished" and never from the
  string ``Mission.status == COMPLETED`` (§6.3, §8.1).  A root whose requirements
  declare a delivery contract is refused until a :class:`DeliveryReceipt` says the
  output actually travelled that far (AER §6.1, §6.3).
* **No implicit permissiveness.**  ``IndependenceFacts()`` reads as "nobody
  produced this and the reviewer holds no rights" and ``ExecutionPosture()`` as
  "nothing is in flight" — the two most permissive possible worlds — so the
  commands carry them with **no defaults**.  Forgetting to look may not become
  acceptable (``verification.acceptance_rules.AcceptanceSubject`` says the same).
* **A Commit re-checks current applicability.**  §25.1 decision 4: an ``ACCEPT``
  verdict recorded earlier is not a standing permission.  The scope epoch, the
  support-set revision (not only the individual evidence rows — AER §7) and the
  ``purpose=ACCEPT`` ``ValidityWitness`` are all re-read inside the transaction,
  and a stale one refuses the command with nothing written.

Boundaries kept from ``plan_commits.py``: a legacy Mission stops at the door
before any migration-16 table is read; there is no raw SQL here; nothing slow runs
inside the transaction; and every refusal carries a stable machine ``reason``
because a stale read-set, a missing child acceptance and an unreached delivery
stage are three different repairs.

        Three things happen here and each is a refusal rather than a repair:

        * the **producer occurrence is read**, never taken from the command.  It is
          the occurrence of the accepted task in the *active* plan revision, so an
          output cannot be filed under an occurrence the acceptance does not belong
          to even if the caller spells one.
        * the **port table is read from the plan's own data requirements**, and
          :func:`~.accepted_outputs.check_against_ports` refuses a port the plan never
          declared or a schema the edge does not carry.  An index entry exists only
          where the plan drew an edge; anything else is a consumer binding to a
          contract that does not exist.
        * a stated output with **no active plan revision** to declare it is refused.
          The alternative — writing it anyway — is an index row whose meaning depends
          on a plan that will be committed later, which is the stale read ADR-13 is
          about.

        A leaf whose result no occurrence consumes has no declared port, so a command
        with no outputs and no unclaimed port writes nothing and asks nothing;
        inventing an entry for it is the ancestor sweep under a typed name.

        P2.3c part 2d, decision 4 adds the fourth refusal, and it is the one that runs
        when the command states *nothing*: a port this occurrence declares, that a
        ``DataRequirement`` actually consumes, and that no output covers, is
        ``OUTPUT_PORT_UNCLAIMED``.  TG implementation design §4.3 says an unprovable
        binding produces an explicit conversion task **or a refusal** — never ``Any``,
        and never a quiet gap — and leaving the port empty here is what made part 2c's
        smoke sit in ``WAITING_DATA`` for ever.  A refusal is recorded and does **not**
        undo the verification (part 2b's rule): it is §9.1's "content defect → a new
        content attempt against the same duty", and the retry path is the ordinary one.

        really delivered was supplied by the same caller that wanted the Mission
        declared complete.  AER §6.1 wants a record; migration 17 gives it a table;
        this writes it.

        The receipt is checked against the store before it is held: it names this

        so too) and belong to this Mission.  Whether that acceptance is still
        **CURRENT** is deliberately *not* checked here and is re-checked where the

        an acceptance that is current when the delivery happens can be superseded
        afterwards, so the question that decides a Mission is "is it current *now,* at
        the moment this root resolution is being formed", not "was it current when
        somebody filed the paperwork".
