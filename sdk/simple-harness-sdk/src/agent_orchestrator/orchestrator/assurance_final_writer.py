"""The unique final writer of an assured Mission (spec §7.1, handoff item 7).

An assured Mission is never completed by ``judge_mission``'s success tail. The
Mission judge records that the success criteria are met and *requests* a
closeout; the CLOSEOUT consumer re-derives readiness (adopted root
GoalResolution, current evidence, root Scope met, effects known, no open
intents / reservations / unknown usage, success judgment recorded) and, when
READY, calls :func:`finalize_assured_mission` inside its own commit
transaction. That call is the only place an assured Mission becomes
COMPLETED: it moves the original missions row, releases the terminal pools,
emits the original ``MissionCompleted``, moves the closeout row READY →
FINALIZED and requests the NOTIFY transport with the final event identity.

Every terminal write on the assured lane — this one and the original failure /
cancellation writers — ends with :func:`request_assured_notification`, so the
Host push chain always learns the final state from a durable event.
Nothing here fabricates readiness: a closeout that is not READY, a Mission
that is not ACTIVE, a judgment that is missing or a row that moved refuse.
