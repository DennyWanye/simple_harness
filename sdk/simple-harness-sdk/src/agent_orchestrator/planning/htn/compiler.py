"""Compiling one grounded method into a checked plan increment (§18.3, TG §5.2).

:func:`compile_refinement` walks the ten steps of the implementation design §5.2
in order and returns a
:class:`~agent_orchestrator.contracts.htn.ProposedPlanDelta` — the only shape a
Commit accepts (§18.3).  It commits nothing, creates no Agent, touches no store
and calls no model; step 10 of the design is precisely "hand it to the single
Commit service", and this module stops one step short of that on purpose.

The three structural decisions it implements, from §24.1:

decision 2
    a compound occurrence compiles to an ``entry``/``exit`` pair of logical gates,
    an external ``P before Q`` becomes ``P.exit → Q.entry``, and a compound with no
    gating children still spans ``entry → exit``.  The gates themselves are built
    by :meth:`~agent_orchestrator.graph.task_network.TaskNetworkSnapshot.execution_projection`;
    what the compiler does is produce a network whose projection has them, and
    then check that it does.
decision 3
    DATA travels through declared ports.  A step argument that reads
    ``OutputValue(step, port)`` becomes a ``DataRequirement`` between the two
    occurrences, and the ports must be declared by the two task types.
decision 9
    a slot that reuses an accepted result keeps its own occurrence.  The reused
    goal occurrence is *referenced*, never re-created and never deleted, and a
    ``REUSE_ACCEPTED`` slot must name the exact acceptance it rests on.

Refusal, not repair: an uncovered root criterion, a cyclic projection, an unbound
required port or a size bound each raise :class:`CompilationRefused` carrying the
structured report.  Silently dropping the offending edge would turn a defect in
the plan into a defect in the execution.

    undispatchable: ``has_admitted_demand`` stayed false and the readiness gate --

    ``INDEPENDENT_AUTHORIZED``
