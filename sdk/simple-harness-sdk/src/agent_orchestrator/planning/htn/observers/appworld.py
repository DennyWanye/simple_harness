"""Read-only observers for the ``appworld`` pilot domain (§7.3 seed library, §6.6).

Five observers over the six predicates the seed ``appworld`` domain declares.  Each
one reads through the *host's* public-read surface —
:meth:`~....evaluation.appworld.AppWorldEpisode.observe_public_api` and the receipt
ledgers beside it — and never through the agent's Python shell: the existing
:data:`~....evaluation.appworld_api_observations.PUBLIC_READ_APIS` policy is an
immutable allowlist of GETs with the exact fields admitted into evidence, which is
precisely the "observers only read" property this package needs.

This file is a **skeleton**, in the sense §7.3 uses: the readers are complete and
the refusals are complete, and the client is injected.  Nothing here starts a
service, and no observer is registered anywhere — wiring these into the evidence
pipeline is the second half of P2.3c.

The distinction that carries the most weight is between *the app says no* and *we
could not ask*:

* an authorised read that comes back and reports the app does not serve this
  request is a negative **observation** (``polarity=False``);
* no client at all, a transport failure, a timeout, or a world whose identity moved
  under the read is :attr:`~.ObservationOutcome.OBSERVER_UNAVAILABLE` with **no**
  record — the service not being up is not evidence about the world (AER §8.2);
* and — the fourth-round addition, runner gap G8 — a read the *host's own policy*
  declines to send is UNAVAILABLE too, not a negative observation.  The frozen
  allowlist admits two ``supervisor`` GETs, so every other application was being
  recorded as a settled negative on the strength of a request that never left the
  process.  :func:`read_is_permitted` splits that case off before the call.

``appworld.action-confirmed`` is the domain's CLOSED predicate.  A receipt ledger
*enumerates* the confirmed actions of an episode, so its answer is a complete,
scoped query and a miss is an authoritative negative — the one shape §6.6 C28 lets a
closed domain conclude FALSE from.  A client that exposes no ledger cannot produce
that completeness claim, so it answers UNAVAILABLE rather than a cheap FALSE.
