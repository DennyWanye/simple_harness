"""P2.3d / defect D1: an AppWorld Mission in the hierarchical mode keeps its domain.

Every one of the Grok acceptance run's 20 L1 episodes reported the same thing from
inside the Worker:

    tools_and_permissions.allowed_tools includes ``appworld_execute``, but this
    attempt's exposed tool schema only contains workspace_list / workspace_read_file /
    workspace_write_file

``_hierarchical_worker_template`` returned the constant ``WORKER_HIERARCHICAL`` for
every prompt version outside a one-element frozenset, which threw away the
``worker-appworld-v3`` template the line above had selected.  ``WORKER_HIERARCHICAL``
is ``_revise(WORKER, …)`` and ``_revise`` copies ``tool_names``, so the role carried
the code domain's four tools; ``effective_tools`` iterates ``role_tools`` and
intersects, so ``appworld_execute`` — present in the Mission, Task and deployment sets
— was dropped for not being in the role's.  The prompt went with it: the Worker was
told to run pytest with ``run_tests`` while operating a simulated world.

The invariant below is the one the diagnosis called "the only one that can stop this".
