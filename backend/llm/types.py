"""Normalized LLM response data model.

Each provider adapter MUST map its native response into these pydantic
models so the agent loop never has to branch on provider-specific shapes.

Usage fields deliberately include cache_read_tokens / cache_write_tokens
as first-class: Anthropic prompt caching (the reason we pay the sticker
price for Claude) reports them, OpenAI exposes `cached_tokens` on gpt-4o,
and Gemini reports 0 on both (context caching only in paid tier). The
caller MUST NOT assume non-Anthropic adapters zero-out these fields by
accident — registry tests enforce all 4 fields present.
