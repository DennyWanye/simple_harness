"""P2.3c part 2: the codec for "which artifact did this Acceptance accept, at which port".

P2.3b left :meth:`HierarchicalDispatch._recorded_outputs` returning nothing and said
why: building an :class:`~..artifacts.input_bindings.AcceptedOutput` needs one fact
the schema did not hold, and guessing the port from an artifact path would be the
all-ancestors sweep §24.1 decision 4 removed, wearing a typed name.  Migration 17's
``acceptance_outputs`` holds the fact; this module is the two functions that put an
``AcceptedOutput`` into that row and take it back out.

Two things it deliberately does *not* do:

* **It does not derive the port.**  ``accepted_outputs_of`` checks that a stated port
  is one the plan actually declares for that producer, and refuses one it does not.
  A port nobody declared is not a typo to be corrected — it is a claim that this
  occurrence produces something the plan never said it produces, and the consumer
  that would bind to it is reading a contract that does not exist.
* **It does not invent a schema.**  The ``schema_ref`` comes from the
  :class:`~..contracts.htn.DataRequirement` that declares the edge, because that is
  the reference the consumer's compatibility check is made against.  Taking it from
  the producer's claim would let a producer relabel its own output.

      consumer: the root's success criterion is what reads that artifact.
