"""P2.3c part 2: the context package a **hierarchical** Planner is actually given.

P2.3b's journal recorded this as blocker (c): the prompt selection did not look at
``is_hierarchical`` and ``build_planner_package`` kept producing the legacy DAG
package.  A Planner told to answer with ``<plan_revision_proposal>`` while being
handed a package about ``budget_for_tasks`` and ``workspace_files`` has nothing to
propose *with* — it does not know which methods are registered, which goals are open,
which plan revision it is answering against, or why the methods it can see were
refused — so every round came back ``proposal_unreadable`` under a real model.

This module builds the other package.  It is a *new* function beside the legacy one
rather than a branch inside it (§18.5 rule 1): ``build_planner_package`` keeps its
exact bytes, so a legacy Mission's request hash does not move.

What the package carries, and why each part is load-bearing:

``plan``
    the current revision and the open compound goals, each with its obligation, its
    goal signature and its bound parameters.  The Planner's ``refine`` operation names
    a ``goal_id`` and an ``obligation_id``; without this section it would be guessing
    both.
``method_library``
    every method the registry holds for those goal signatures, with the exact
    ``method_ref`` triple (id / version / content_hash) the operation must quote.  The
    triple is the whole point: §18.5 forbids the model to invent a version or a hash,
    and a model that is not *shown* them can only invent them.
``applicability``
    why an applicable-looking method was refused, split by axis (preconditions,
    parameters, capabilities, authority).  This is the input the MethodSynthesizer
    needs to be worth calling at all — "no method fits" is not actionable, "no method
    fits because none of them declares the ``code.run-tests`` capability this
    deployment has" is.
``operators``
    the capabilities this deployment really registered, and the ones a method could
    ask for and not get.  A method proposal that requires a capability nobody runs is
    refused at admission, so telling the Planner in advance is the difference between
    one wasted round and none.

Nothing here decides anything.  Every value is read from the store, the registry and
the deployment, and the Planner's answer still goes through ``parse_plan_proposal`` →
``assess_method`` → ``compile_refinement_bundle`` → ``commit_plan_revision`` before a
single row moves.

    So each entry carries a ready-made ``read_set_entry``: the observation's id, the
    semantic revision and the content hash the checker recomputes
    (``_read_set.ReadSetChecker.observation_state``).  Copy it, do not derive it.

    Review P2-13: **who computes that entry** is the checker, when a caller hands one
    over.  ``ReadSetChecker.read_item``'s own docstring says the proposing side and
    the checking side must agree on what a semantic revision is and that writing the
    formula twice is how they stop agreeing — and this function was the second place
    it was written.  ``read_item`` is therefore a callable ``(ReadItemKind, id) ->
    ReadItem``; the literal below is the offline form, used only when no checker is
    available (a package rendered without a store behind it).

    Two deliberate limits:

    * **Only the newest observation per proposition.**  An earlier record for the
      same proposition is *superseded*, and the read-set checker reports exactly that
      — so offering it would be handing the Planner an entry guaranteed to refuse the
      commit.
    * **No predicate statement.**  ``ObservationRecord`` keys a fact by
      ``proposition_key``, a digest of the signature and the grounded arguments, and
      the record does not carry the signature itself.  Rather than reconstruct a name
      the store does not hold, the fact is quoted by its key and the *names* stay in
      ``applicability``, where the unknown preconditions are listed.

    where each kind's hash comes from, and the only value this function may emit is
    that *authoritative* one.  So a source that does not carry a hash — a task whose

    a fabricated one fails that comparison *after* the model has been told to quote
