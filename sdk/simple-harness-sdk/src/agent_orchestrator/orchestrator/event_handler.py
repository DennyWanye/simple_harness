"""The Orchestrator control loop (§4, §7.5, §24) for a static Task DAG (step 3).

Observe → Plan → Allocate → Execute → Verify → Commit → Repeat, as a
deterministic *workflow shell* around the model calls (theory 08-8): every
action below is an idempotent Commit, so ``run()`` can be interrupted at any
instruction and restarted (``recover()`` first) without a second execution, a
second delivery or a second charge.  Fault points (``self._fault(...)``) mark the
cross-database crash instants of the recovery matrix (plan D14', D3-6').

Step 3 adds: the Planner proposes a whole graph, the Frontier / Allocator decide
which READY Tasks get an Attempt under the concurrency bound, a downstream
Attempt starts from its ancestors' accepted artifacts (frozen as inputs and
protected), accepting a result also supersedes the sibling candidates and
unblocks the dependents in the same transaction, a stop cascades to every open
Task, and the Mission is judged on the integrated tree of every Task.

        P2.3c part 2d, decision 2.  §15 makes a Mission a **bounded** cycle: "somebody
        could admit a demand later" belongs to the next cycle or to the Commitment
        above it, not to this one, and a run that never ends cannot enter the paired
        evaluation §21.5 asks for.  But §9.1 licenses stopping on *repeated* no
        progress, not on the first idle turn — and part 2c's smoke showed why: one
        evidence round or one witness re-issue moved the world twice.

        So exactly **one** more complete cycle runs — re-issue both licence lanes,
        one evidence round, advance the compound phases, re-read the admissions — and
        the fingerprint is taken again.  Moved: nothing happens and the loop is free to
        carry on.  Identical: :meth:`CommitService.fail_mission` ends the Mission with
        ``NO_DISPATCHABLE_WORK`` and a §6.4-shaped report — the structure that *was*
        expanded and the duties that are still outstanding, never a claim that the goal
        is impossible (§7.4).

        One cycle, hard-coded.  A ``while`` here would turn an idle loop into a busy
        one, which is the failure this method exists to end.

        Returns whether the loop should **carry on** — third-round review P1-A.
        The confirmation cycle is a cycle *with side effects*: it re-issues both
        licence lanes, records observations and advances compound phases, and the
        decision memo's own wording for a moved fingerprint is "do nothing, **let the
        loop carry on**".  :meth:`run` used to return unconditionally afterwards, so a
        Mission the confirmation had just unblocked — one admitted demand is enough —
        was handed back to the caller as "idle" with a ``READY_CANDIDATE`` occurrence
        and not one Attempt created.  That is exactly the case the memo protected when
        it rejected the alternative design.

        So the answer is "the world moved, go round again" — and it is bounded by
        :data:`MAX_STALL_CARRY_ONS` per Mission per :meth:`run`.  The bound is not
        decoration: a confirmation cycle *records observations*, so a deployment whose
        observers answer something new every time would move the fingerprint for ever
        and the carry-on would be the busy loop this whole path exists to end.  Past
        the bound the run simply returns — the Mission stays ACTIVE with its stall
        recorded, which is the caller's answer and not a verdict about the Mission.

        A ``False`` therefore means "nothing here needs another cycle": either a
        Mission was stopped, or there was no stalled hierarchical Mission at all.

        outcome under the right key, and the findings ride in the request as their
        own field.

        A **new role**, not a new version of an existing one, and that shows in three
        places rather than one:

        * its own role template (``METHOD_SYNTHESIZER``), so it cannot masquerade as a
          Task Critic;
        * its own budget account — the Mission's planning account, which is the
          ``mission_planning`` account of §13 v1.4 — so a synthesis round never lands
          on the Task budget of whatever goal happened to need a method;
        * its own typed context, ``synthesis.build_request``, which carries no
          Mission id, no principal and no budget field at all.

        The reply is admitted through
        :meth:`HierarchicalDispatch.apply_synthesizer_reply`, where the author is
        fixed at ``MODEL``.

        P2.3d / defect D5-A.  Before this, a root review that concluded REJECT was the
        end of the Mission: ``record_review`` wrote the record, announced
        :data:`~.root_review.ROOT_REVIEW_REJECTED`, and the loop returned False.  There
        was no re-planning, no further work and no route by which the finding reached
        anybody — the Mission went idle and stopped with
        ``hierarchical_no_dispatchable_work``.  Ten episodes of the Grok acceptance run
        ended that way with every leaf accepted and, in nine of them, a deliverable the
        official grader passed.

        Three things keep this from becoming the silent retry §9.1 forbids:

        * only a **blocker** finding opens it.  A reviewer that rejected over minor
          limitations is not asking for a new plan, and re-planning on that would be
          this loop deciding the review was wrong;
        * the findings travel as a durable ``PlanningRejected`` record, which is what
          ``_planning_rejections`` feeds into the next proposal — the Planner is told
          what the reviewer said, not merely asked again;
        * the bound is **per Mission** (``max_root_review_repairs``, default 1), and
          a revision is never re-planned twice.  Verification P1-1 of P2.3j: counted
          per revision, every replacement revision earned a fresh repair, and with two
          methods in the library the Planner oscillated outer → alt → outer until a
          budget ran out (or the re-adoption collided with the retired instance's id).
          A Mission out of repairs falls through to the idle stall exactly as before,
          with the rejection in its stop report.

        Review P2-3: "one more round" is what *this* branch opens, not what the Mission
        then spends.  The round it opens is an ordinary Planner round, so if its
        proposal is refused ``_planning_rejected`` climbs the ordinary ladder — up to
        ``max_planning_attempts`` in total, not one.  That is the intended behaviour
        (a repair whose first proposal was unreadable is not a repair that was tried);
        what is bounded here is how many times a *root review rejection* may reopen
        planning at all.  The cross-revision bound is ``max_root_review_cuts``: each
        repair produces a new revision whose acceptances move the contributions, which
        spends a cut, and the cut budget ends the chain with
        ``HierarchicalRootReviewCutBudgetSpent``.
