"""P2.3c part 2: the bridge from a plan **occurrence** to a dispatchable ``Task`` row.

P2.3b left the hierarchical mode unable to dispatch anything, and the reason was
narrow: ``commit_plan_revision`` writes memberships, method instances and semantic
bindings, but no legacy ``Task`` row.  ``Store.list_tasks`` therefore came back
empty, the legacy allocator saw no work and ``_decide`` returned at ``if not
tasks``.  This module is the missing half.

Three decisions are load-bearing, and each one is a decision *not* to be clever:

* **The Task contract is reused, not extended.**  An occurrence materialises an
  ordinary ``kind="work"`` Task whose meaning already lives in ``task_semantics``
  (§18.5: the semantic binding sits *beside* the Task, it does not replace it).
  Nothing about the hierarchy is encoded in the Task row, which is why the row can
  be rebuilt from the plan at any time.

* **``dependencies`` stay empty.**  It is tempting to project ORDER constraints onto
  ``Task.dependency_ids`` so the legacy allocator's READY arithmetic "just works".
  That would be wrong twice: the legacy rule is *conjunctive* (every dependency
  COMPLETED), so an OR method's alternatives would each block the other forever,
  and an ORDER edge released by ``order_released`` under a non-default
  ``ReleaseCondition`` is not the same fact as "the predecessor is COMPLETED".
  Ordering in this mode is answered by ``evaluate_readiness`` over the typed
  network, and encoding it in ``dependency_ids`` would put a second, disagreeing
  answer in the database (§18.5 hard constraint 4, §24.1 decision 6).

* **A compound gets a row too, and it is never dispatched.**  The row exists so a
  compound is *visible* — listings, the Manager's read, the operator UI — and it is
  refused at three independent gates: ``form=compound`` in
  ``legacy_ready_is_not_eligibility`` (the allocator's ``evaluate_frontier_v2`` and
  ``HierarchicalDispatch.intercept_worker_dispatch` both ask that one function), and
  ``admit_for_dispatch`` which only builds an ``EligiblePrimitiveTask`` for a
  primitive.  Its status is BLOCKED, never READY, so even a reader that mistakes the
  display index for a permission finds the answer "no".

The budget share is the other thing this module owns.  ``BudgetLedger.open_account``
refuses a child whose limits do not fit its parent, so the share has to be computed
rather than guessed: what is left of the Mission's task pool (its budget minus the
system reserve, minus what the existing rows already hold) is divided over the
occurrences this round funds *plus one share held back for every compound nobody has
refined yet*, and every other dimension the Mission bounds is inherited.  See
:func:`share_tokens` for why the divisor counts the unrefined compounds, and
:meth:`Materialisation.conservation` for the equation the suite checks each round.
