"""P2.3b: the assembly layer of the hierarchical mode (§14, §7.2, TG §7/§8).

``event_handler.py`` is a 6000-line single class, and §18.2's line about it is an
instruction not to make that worse: *"only assemble and call the new
planning/repair/commit modules; do not keep piling every algorithm into this
file"*.  So everything the new mode needs between "the Planner answered" and
"one plan revision is committed" lives here, and the event handler holds one
optional collaborator and five ``if hierarchical`` branches.

Four things this module is responsible for, and one it deliberately is not:

* **One round of planning.**  :meth:`HierarchicalDispatch.apply_planner_reply`
  runs ``parse_plan_proposal`` → ``assess_method`` / ``ground_method`` →
  ``compile_refinement_bundle`` → ``commit_plan_revision``.  A refusal whose
  reason a *recompilation* could fix is retried by compiling again against the
  freshly read snapshot — at most ``compile_attempts`` times in total — and then
  the round stops with a ``PlanCommitRefused`` event.  There is no rebase here
  and no unbounded retry: ADR-13 / C19 say a hierarchical proposal is handed back
  to its author, never replayed on its behalf.
* **Reading the plan through the projection.**  ``list``, ready, terminal, the
  concurrency count and the root review all go through
  :class:`~..graph.task_network.TaskNetworkSnapshot` and
  :func:`~..graph.eligibility.evaluate_readiness` (TG §7 last paragraph).  The
  string ``TaskStatus.READY`` is a rebuildable display index in this mode and is
  never a criterion — :attr:`TaskView.legacy_status` carries it for diagnostics
  only.
* **Compound tasks advance without a Worker.**  :func:`next_compound_phase` is a
  pure reducer over typed inputs; :meth:`advance_compound_phases` records what it
  says.  No Attempt is created for a compound, ever (TG §7), and
  :meth:`intercept_worker_dispatch` refuses one with ``NEEDS_REFINEMENT`` before
  the allocator's old READY entry can walk it into the Worker path (§18.5 rule 4).
* **Inputs come from the manifest.**  :meth:`attempt_inputs` asks
  :mod:`..artifacts.versioning` for the ``InputManifest`` path, so an ORDER-only
  predecessor contributes nothing (§24.1 decisions 3 and 4).

What it is *not*: an authority.  Every write still goes through
``CommitService``; every judgement still comes from ``graph/``; a missing
semantic binding is reported as :class:`GraphIntegrityError` rather than quietly
handled, because §18.5 calls that corruption and not a legacy fallback.

DISPATCH_INTERCEPTED = "HierarchicalDispatchIntercepted"
COMPOUND_PHASE_CHANGED = "CompoundPhaseChanged"
#: P2.3c part 2: one occurrence was *not* dispatched this cycle, and the structured
#: reason why.  A separate name from ``DISPATCH_INTERCEPTED`` because that one is the
#: safety refusal of a compound and this one is the ordinary "not yet" of the readiness
#: gate; an operator reading a Mission that is not moving has to be able to tell
#: "the plan is wrong" from "the producer has not finished".
DISPATCH_WITHHELD = "HierarchicalDispatchWithheld"
#: P2.3c part 2: the Mission's root GoalResolution was offered and refused.  Recorded
#: because "the Mission did not complete" is not a diagnosis — which rule refused it is.
ROOT_RESOLUTION_REFUSED = "RootGoalResolutionRefused"
#: P2.3c part 2c (review F1): a hierarchical Mission reached the scheduler on a
#: deployment that never installed this assembly.  The gates live here and the
#: occurrence rows are written by the Commit Service, so the two can be out of step;
#: when they are, the Mission is refused rather than handed to the legacy allocator,
#: and this is the record of the refusal.  One event per Mission — the condition is a
#: deployment fact, so it does not change from cycle to cycle and repeating it every
#: cycle would drown the log it is supposed to explain.
ASSEMBLY_MISSING = "HierarchicalAssemblyMissing"
#: P2.3c part 2c: the loop went idle while this Mission still had occurrences every
#: gate withheld.  It is a *record*, not a verdict: the Mission is left exactly where
#: it is (no status change, nothing cancelled), because "this process has nothing left
#: to do" and "this Mission can never progress" are different statements and only the
#: first one is known here — a demand admitted, an approval granted or an observation
#: recorded from outside would make the very same plan runnable.  What it does end is
#: the silence: the withheld reasons are written down where an operator reads them
#: rather than left to be re-derived from a Mission that simply stopped moving.
MISSION_STALLED = "HierarchicalMissionStalled"
#: P2.3c part 2c: a licence could not be recorded because the consumer already holds a
#: START row for this scope epoch and support revision.  It is a *storage* limit, not a

#: occurrence that needed the licence then waits for a reason nobody could otherwise see.
WITNESS_KEY_TAKEN = "HierarchicalWitnessKeyTaken"

#: P2.3c part 3a.  The root ``MISSION_FINAL`` review package was cut, and an earlier
#: one was retired.  The two names live *here*, beside the reader that has to honour
#: them (:meth:`HierarchicalDispatch.live_root_review_package`), rather than in
#: ``orchestrator.root_review`` which writes them: "which review does the root
#: resolve from" is a question this module already answers, and an answer that could
#: not see a supersede record would resolve from an anchor the world has moved past.
ROOT_REVIEW_CUT = "HierarchicalRootReviewCut"
ROOT_REVIEW_SUPERSEDED = "HierarchicalRootReviewSuperseded"
#: G1 (Host acceptance runner): why each registered method was refused for each still
#: open goal, at the plan revision the Planner was asked against.  The four-axis
#: report was computed for the *prompt* and thrown away, so after a run nobody could
#: say why a method had not been chosen — the runner had to re-derive it with a probe.
#: One record per ``(mission, plan_revision)`` while the library is unchanged.  A method
#: the Planner proposes joins the library *without* moving the plan revision, so the key
#: grows ``:library:{n}`` with the number of proposals; otherwise the round after a
#: proposal would reuse the assessment made before it.
METHOD_APPLICABILITY_ASSESSED = "MethodApplicabilityAssessed"

#: not steal; the durable continuation resumes it when the last blocker settles.
REPAIR_BLOCKED_BY_RUNNING_WORK = "repair_blocked_by_running_work"

# later, but the trigger, program-computed impact and admitted action survive a
# process restart as one idempotent event.
REPAIR_DECISION_DISPATCHED = "RepairDecisionDispatched"

#: How many refusals one :data:`METHOD_APPLICABILITY_ASSESSED` payload carries.  Far
#: larger than the prompt's own cap (that one protects the model's attention; this one
#: only stops a pathological registry from writing an unbounded row), and a payload
#: that hits it says so in ``truncated`` instead of quietly ending.
MAX_RECORDED_REFUSALS = 200

#: How many times one Planner reply may be compiled in total.  Two means: compile,
#: and if the commit was refused for a reason a fresh snapshot could fix, compile
#: once more against that snapshot.  It is a small number on purpose — a third
#: attempt against a Mission that is moving underneath the proposer is a busy
#: loop, and the honest answer is to hand the round back with a named reason.
DEFAULT_COMPILE_ATTEMPTS = 2

#: The refusals a *recompilation against the current snapshot* can plausibly fix:
#: the four staleness gates, the structural ones that compare the increment against
#: the plan it was compiled from, and the two budget ones.
#:
#: Everything else is deliberately absent.  A forged principal, a payload conflict,
#: a terminal Mission, a missing semantic binding, an unresolvable read, a delta the
#: compiler did not mark commit-ready and an unresolved OR say something about the

        same world, re-issued) and comes back; or the *key* is held by a different
        licence and the answer is None.

        Since migration 18 the key carries ``subject`` — which object this licence was

        one row.  ``None`` now means what it always claimed to mean: two different

        is a real contradiction and is reported rather than swallowed.

        Third-round review P2-1 closed the way that claim was still escapable.  Both
        production lanes derive ``witness_id`` from the key's own components, so a
        contention shows up as a **primary-key** conflict rather than an index one —
        and the old recovery re-read the row *by id* and returned it, whatever it
        said.  A second, opposite reading of the same world therefore inherited the
        first reading's ``USABLE`` licence in silence (visible the moment a revoke or
        supersede command exists: the same acceptance goes CURRENT → REVOKED and
        ``issue_input_witnesses`` hands back the old permission).  So the row that
        comes back is now *compared*: identical conclusion → the same licence,

        P2.3c part 2d, decision 4.  Part 2c's smoke ended here: the plan declared one
        output port, the model wrote two files under names of its own, and nothing had
        ever told it that ``repository_facts`` was the name the plan used.  The accept
        side then paired by substring (``artifacts/…`` matches a port called ``facts``)
        or by "one port, one file" — the guess TG design §10.2 forbids — or, honestly
        but uselessly, not at all.

        The ports come from :func:`~.accepted_outputs.output_ports_in_revision`, the
        same function the accept side checks against, so "which ports exist" has one
        answer rather than two.  A port is in this list because a ``DataRequirement``
        consumes it **or** because a ``criterion_link`` of the adopted method points at
        this occurrence (P2.3d / defect D3: the finalizer step's port has no downstream
        edge and the root's success criterion still reads it, so a leaf that was never
        told the port existed delivered nothing and the root review rejected the
        Mission).  An occurrence that is neither consumed nor criterion-linked feeds
        nobody and is not asked for at all.

        Deliberately **not** intersected with the binding's own ``output_ports``.  The
        memo describes the two sources as an intersection, and a port a live edge
        consumes while the producer's contract does not declare it *is* a real defect —
        but it is a defect in the **plan**, and answering it by quietly dropping the
        port here would hide it: the leaf would then be told to produce nothing, the
        consumer would wait for a port nobody was asked for, and the Mission would stall
        with no reason anybody could read.  Plan integrity is where that belongs, and
        until it refuses there, the honest thing is to ask for the port the edge needs
        and let ``OUTPUT_PORT_UNCLAIMED`` name it if it never arrives.  The binding is
        consulted for ``cardinality`` only, because that is where TG §4.3 declares it;
        a port the binding does not list is reported ``single``, the contract's own
        default.

        This is the input :func:`~..scheduling.allocator.allocate_v2` takes, and it is
        the answer to P2.3b's blocker (b): before P2.3c part 2 the event handler only
        asked the *form* gate before creating an Attempt, so a DATA consumer whose
        producer had not been accepted was dispatched with no inputs and ran anyway.
        Now every occurrence goes through ``evaluate_readiness`` first and only a
        ``READY_CANDIDATE`` reaches ``admit_for_dispatch``.

        Three properties worth stating, because each is a way this could have been
        written wrongly:

        * **One read.**  ``self.read()`` fetches the acceptance projection, the
          witnesses and the duty accounts once and every occurrence is judged against
          that same snapshot, so the plan cannot move between two occurrences'
          verdicts — and ``admit_for_dispatch``'s ``_same_origin`` check would refuse
          the admission if it had.
        * **A refusal is never an admission with a flag.**  An occurrence that is not
          ready simply has no :class:`EligiblePrimitiveTask`; the allocator takes only
          admissions, so there is no field a caller could misread as a permission.
        * **``NotEligible`` at this point is fail-closed, not a retry.**  A report that
          said ``READY_CANDIDATE`` and an admission that refuses it means the report
          and the view disagree — a race or a caller bug — and the honest answer is to
          withhold this occurrence with the refusal text, not to admit it anyway.
