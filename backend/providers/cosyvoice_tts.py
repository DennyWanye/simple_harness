"""CosyVoice 2 local TTS provider with graceful edge-tts fallback (R11).

V5 §4.1 / Phase 2 goal: run a fully-local TTS stack when the machine
has enough VRAM + the cosyvoice package installed. When any precondition
fails we drop back to edge-tts so the voice pipeline keeps working — the
caller never sees the difference except in the startup log line.

Why the fallback chain lives inside the provider (not at registration
time in main.py): the availability of CosyVoice depends on runtime state
(torch CUDA, model weights, python package install). Deciding at module
import forces a restart to reconfigure; doing it inside ``load()`` means
the user can ``pip install cosyvoice`` and just restart uvicorn.

Expected weight layout (from the ModelScope bundle):

    backend/assets/cosyvoice2/
        llm.pt
        flow.pt
        hift.pt
        campplus.onnx
        speech_tokenizer_v2.onnx
        cosyvoice2.yaml
        ...

``model_dir`` points at that directory. The reference prompt audio lives
under ``asset/`` inside the bundle and is used for zero-shot cloning.
