"""Task Graph proposal (§6, §15, plan D3-1/D3-2): parse, validate as a whole, order.

A ``TaskGraphProposal`` is what the Planner emits inside ``<task_graph_proposal>``.
``validate_graph`` performs the Graph Manager checks of §24 step 3 — missing /
self / cyclic dependencies, duplicates, budgets within the Mission on every
limited dimension **and** in sum, tools within the Mission, at least one root and
one terminal task — and returns the deterministic topological order used to
assign formal ids.  Any failure rejects the whole proposal (``GraphRejected``);
nothing is written.

    """The hierarchical-mode graph gate (§18.5, ADR-08).

    Two things differ from :func:`validate_graph`, and nothing else does:

    * the size bounds come from a *versioned* :class:`GraphStructureBudget` rather
      than from the module constants ``MAX_TASKS`` / ``MAX_GRAPH_DEPTH``, so a
      deployment that raises them records which budget version admitted the plan
      instead of shipping a different constant;
    * ``dependencies`` and the typed ORDER/DATA edges must describe the *same* set of
      relations — the cross-table invariant §18.5 asks for, so that the projection a
      scheduler reads cannot drift away from the relations the plan actually holds.
      This is a representation check, not an OR gate: the graph layer reads several
      dependencies as AND, and what confines a choice to the method-instance layer is
      ``PlanCommitsMixin._check_or_resolved_at_method_layer``.

    Exceeding a bound is ``bound_reached`` with the offending dimension named — never
    a silently trimmed graph and never "the goal is impossible" (ADR-08).
