"""P2.3d / defect D2b: "look again" stops being an answer once the looking is settled.

``SYNTHESIS_WORTHY_REFUSALS`` deliberately leaves ``NEEDS_EVIDENCE`` out — the repair
for an unknown precondition is to observe, not to invent a method.  That is right
until observing cannot change anything, and the Grok acceptance run found the case
where it cannot.

``code.test-is-failing`` is an **OPEN** predicate.  The observer ran ``pytest tests``,
found the suite green, and recorded ``polarity=false`` with ``coverage=BEST_EFFORT``.
§6.6: a non-authoritative negative in an open world contributes ``NO_SUPPORT``, so
``atom_truth`` answers UNKNOWN — not FALSE.  Every method for the goal was therefore
``NEEDS_EVIDENCE``, and the two repairs cancelled each other out every cycle:

* ``_gather_evidence`` recorded another observation and reported progress;
* ``goals_needing_method`` returned nothing, because NEEDS_EVIDENCE is not
  synthesis-worthy;
* the truth stayed UNKNOWN, because the observation was the same one again.

All six L3 episodes burned their planning ladder in that live-lock.  The narrow fix is
below: a precondition one observer has already read ``evidence_saturation_rounds``
times, still unknown, counts as a refusal a *different method* could route around.

What is deliberately **not** widened: I18.  Nothing here turns UNKNOWN into TRUE or
opens a safety gate — it only decides whether proposing a new method is a sensible
next question.
