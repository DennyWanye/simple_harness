"""P2.3o: turn a bound InputManifest into the consumer's workspace baseline.

Hierarchical dispatch places exactly the resolved InputManifest (§24.1 decision 4):
an ORDER-only predecessor contributes nothing.  A ``patch`` port still only names
the diff document (``patch.diff``, ``out/patch.json``).  The files the producer
actually changed live on that Attempt as extra accepted artifacts — Grok C3's
apply-patch leaf accepted ``stats/window.py`` next to ``patch.diff``.

A downstream leaf (verify, inspect@2, summarize@2) that starts from the unpatched
seed then either re-applies the patch (P2.3m's same-hash rewrite) or lists the
patched path on its envelope.  ``rule_check`` looks at the Attempt's *recorded*
artifacts, which no longer include that path, and fails
``artifact '…' is not a recorded workspace file``.  ``code_test`` rebuilds from
seed + the diff document and runs against the red baseline.

This module does three pure things and writes nothing:

* :func:`overlay_bound_producer_files` — for each bound producer, add the accepted
  artifacts that overlay the consumer's seed.  The port document stays; REPORT.md
  and other non-seed files stay off the baseline (they are the producer's own
  outputs, not product code).
* :func:`bound_artifacts_named_in_envelope` — an envelope path that names a bound
  input is a recorded workspace file for ``rule_check``, even when the collector
  dropped it as "already accepted" (P2.3m).
* :func:`files_patched_by_unified_diff` — P2.3v: when the producer accepted only
  the diff document, apply it onto seed bytes so the patched paths can be
  recorded.  Unsafe paths, missing seed files and hunk mismatches refuse the
  whole document (P1-1).
