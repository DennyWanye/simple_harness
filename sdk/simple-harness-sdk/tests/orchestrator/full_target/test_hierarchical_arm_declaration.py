"""G5: the matrix may name a hierarchical arm, and the frozen four keep their bytes.

The Host's acceptance runner needs an arm identity for the hierarchical executor so
that an HTN run can be paired against the frozen S/R/D/F baseline.  The arm set was
closed to those four, so an `H` run had nowhere to be declared.

What must stay true is the *identity* of the baseline: a manifest that names only
S/R/D/F must serialise to the same bytes, and therefore hash to the same fingerprint
and generate the same run ids, as it did before `H` existed.  That is why `H` is
appended after the four rather than sorted in, and why `ARMS` still means the four.
