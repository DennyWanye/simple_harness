"""FULL-TARGET P2.3c part 2d, decision 4: the Worker declares its output ports.

Which of an Attempt's files is the ``repository_facts`` a downstream step asked for
is a **local key** — TG design §3.2 gives the model local keys, business goals and
parameters and binds everything else (Mission identity, accounts, scope, execution
generation) itself.  So the port↔artifact pairing is *declared* by the producer and
*checked* here, and the two old fallbacks — "the port name appears somewhere in the
path" and "one port, one artifact, so they go together" — are gone: §10.2 forbids
settling "which file is this" by name or by position.

The tests below are the parser's four structural refusals plus the template
property: the prompt asks the model for the local key and for nothing the system
binds.

#: The sha256 of every shipped prompt whose bytes a replayable Mission depends on.
#: Frozen **here**, as literals, for the reason the third-round review found the hard
#: way: the previous guard compared the templates against ``git show HEAD:``, and the
#: moment the hierarchical worker was committed ``HEAD`` became the new file — so the
#: test was comparing the templates with themselves, went permanently red on the
#: ``hasattr`` line, and the invariant it stood for ("a shipped prompt never changes
#: its bytes") had no guard left at all.  A digest in the test file cannot move with
#: the tree, needs no ``git`` to check, and says exactly which byte changed when it
#: fails.  This is the same technique the migration checksums use.
#:
#: **Changing a value here is never the fix for a failing assertion.**  An Attempt
#: freezes its ``prompt_version`` and replays on those bytes (§26.3); editing a
#: shipped template in place silently rewrites the past.  A new wording is a new
#: version, registered beside the old one, with its own line below.

# The two wiring steps decision 4 rests on (third-round review P1-B)

# The parsing side, the pairing side and the refusing side all had tests.  The two
# steps *between* them did not, and both mutants survived the whole suite: stop
# handing the model the port names, and stop swapping in the prompt that asks for
# them.  Either one on its own reproduces part 2c's round-9 blocker — every leaf
# refused with ``OUTPUT_PORT_UNCLAIMED`` and the Mission stopped with no dispatchable
# work — so both are asserted here against a real dispatch intent.
