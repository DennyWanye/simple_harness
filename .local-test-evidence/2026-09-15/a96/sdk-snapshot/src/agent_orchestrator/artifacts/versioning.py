"""Artifact propagation and versioning across the DAG (§20.3, plan D3-7'/D3-8').

A downstream Attempt starts from the *accepted* artifacts of **all** its ancestors,
applied in topological order: a later producer overrides an earlier one only when
it depends (transitively) on that producer — it saw the earlier file and changed
it on purpose.  Two producers that are independent of each other (parallel
branches) giving the same path *different* content is an ``ArtifactConflict``
(never silently pick one); the same content is not a conflict.  The resulting
``(task_id, path, content_hash)`` set is frozen into the dispatch intent as the
Attempt's inputs, so a later inspection can tell exactly which upstream version a
result was built on — and the verifier re-materialises those inputs as protected
files (a downstream Worker may not rewrite what it was given).
