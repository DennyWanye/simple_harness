"""P2.3c part 2b · a hierarchical Mission on a real model (opt in: ``--run-real-provider``).

Part 2's §10 recorded two reasons the smoke run never happened: there was no
deployment-side ``PlanningWorld``, and the endpoint that round was unusable.  Part
2b built the first; this file is the run.

What it asserts is the **closure**, never the wording of a stochastic model:

* the hierarchical Planner round is *readable* — the blocker P2.3b left was that a
  Planner asked for a ``<plan_revision_proposal>`` while holding the legacy DAG
  package had nothing to propose with, and every round came back
  ``proposal_unreadable``.  A run in which that reason appears at all is a failure
  of this slice, whatever the Mission's final status;
* the Mission ends either ``COMPLETED`` or with an **honest** stop: not completed,
  and every refusal carries a structured, machine-readable reason.

Credentials come from ``SH_BASEURL`` / ``SH_APIKEY`` / ``SH_MODEL`` and never reach
the evidence directory.  The raw receipts go to ``.local-test-evidence/`` (ignored);
the journal keeps only the text conclusion.
