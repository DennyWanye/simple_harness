"""Manual E2E for PPT + DeepResearch.

What it does
------------
1. Runs ``deepresearch`` against a fixed topic with a deterministic
   FakeLLM (no live network needed) and prints the resulting report.
2. Pipes the report's section titles into ``ppt_create`` to produce a
   real ``.pptx`` file on disk. Asserts the file exists, slide count,
   and dumps the file path.

Why
---
This is the "smoke test" that proves the modules cooperate end-to-end.
It's separate from pytest so we can run it locally and inspect the
.pptx in PowerPoint / Keynote manually.

Run
---
    cd backend
    python scripts/e2e_ppt_deepresearch.py
