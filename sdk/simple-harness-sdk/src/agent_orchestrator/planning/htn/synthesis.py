"""The MethodSynthesizer's *system* side (§7.3 source 4, §18.5 C8).

§7.3 lists four sources a new method may come from, and an LLM proposing a
candidate for a goal nobody has a method for is one of them.  It is not a special
source: it goes through the *same* six-step admission protocol as a human-written
one, and it stops at ``TRIAL_ADMITTED`` like everything else in P2.

This module is the half of that which is not a model call:

:meth:`MethodSynthesizer.build_request`
    build the **typed context** the synthesising role is given — the goal signature
    it must satisfy, the criteria it has to cover, the operators this deployment
    actually registers (with whether their capability is healthy), the applicability
    reports of the methods that were tried and did not fit, and the list of fields
    the model may not write.  A prompt assembled from prose would let a model widen
    its own options; a request assembled from the catalogue cannot.
:meth:`MethodSynthesizer.accept_response`
    take the ``<method_proposal>`` block back, parse it strictly, and hand it to
    :meth:`~.registry.MethodRegistry.admit`.  Nothing is normalised on the way in:
    §7.3 and §6.3 put the registry status *outside* the definition, so a payload
    that spells ``ADMITTED`` is refused with ``MODEL_CLAIMED_STATUS`` and the
    refusal is recorded — quietly rewriting it to ``DRAFT`` would hide the attempt.

What is deliberately **not** here:

* **the model call.**  §18.5 says the MethodSynthesizer goes through the existing
  persistent dispatch intent, ``BaseAgent`` and cost channel, and that a new role
  purpose "must not masquerade as a Task Critic and land on the wrong Task
  budget".  So this module never calls a provider; the second half of P2.3c wires
  :data:`~...runtime.role_templates.METHOD_SYNTHESIZER` through ``BaseAgent`` on the
  mission-planning account.
* **promotion.**  There is no ``promote`` on :class:`MethodSynthesizer`, by
  construction: past ``TRIAL_ADMITTED`` lies the offline multi-instance evaluation
  P8 delivers, and :meth:`~.registry.MethodRegistry.promote` answers
  ``PROMOTION_NOT_AVAILABLE`` for every target.  Succeeding once is not a promotion.
