"""Artifact propagation and versioning across the DAG (§20.3, plan D3-7'/D3-8').

A downstream Attempt starts from the *accepted* artifacts of **all** its ancestors,
applied in topological order: a later producer overrides an earlier one only when
it depends (transitively) on that producer — it saw the earlier file and changed
it on purpose.  Two producers that are independent of each other (parallel
branches) giving the same path *different* content is an ``ArtifactConflict``
(never silently pick one); the same content is not a conflict.  The resulting
``(task_id, path, content_hash)`` set is frozen into the dispatch intent as the
Attempt's inputs, so a later inspection can tell exactly which upstream version a
result was built on — and the verifier re-materialises those inputs as protected
files (a downstream Worker may not rewrite what it was given).

# ======================================================================================
# P2.3b: the hierarchical mode's path (§24.1 decisions 3, 4 and 11; TG §10.1-10.3)
# ======================================================================================
#
# Everything above this line is the legacy mode and stays exactly as it was: §18.2 asks
# for ``merge_accepted`` / ``collect_upstream_inputs`` / ``topological`` byte-for-byte
# unchanged, and the suite hashes their source to hold that.  The diagnostic readers
# (``observability/traces.py``, ``observability/evaluation.py``) keep calling those
# three and therefore keep tolerating a damaged graph, which is the whole point of
# decision 11: an operator's view of a broken Mission must still render.
#
# Below the line is the new mode, and it differs in three ways that are not details:
#
# 1. **Nothing is swept.**  A consumer starts from its resolved ``InputManifest`` and
#    from nothing else.  An ORDER-only predecessor contributes no file however many
#    artifacts it accepted — ORDER is a release condition, never a read permission
#    (§24.1 decision 1).
# 2. **A path collision is refused, not ranked.**  Two different hashes aimed at one
#    target place raise :class:`ArtifactConflict`; "B is further down the topological
#    order" is not a reason to pick B (TG §10.2).  The same hash at one place is one
#    file two bindings agree on, which is not a conflict — the same rule the legacy
#    merge already applied to exact paths, so decision 4's "do not relax the old
#    protection before the new path is wired" holds.
# 3. **A damaged projection stops the work.**  On this path an unorderable projection
#    raises :class:`~..graph.projection_validation.GraphIntegrityError` rather than
#    returning the healthy prefix, because the healthy prefix is a partial order and
#    not a plan.
