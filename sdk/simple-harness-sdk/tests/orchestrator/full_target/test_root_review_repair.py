"""P2.3d / defect D5-A: §9.1's repair branch after a root review says REJECT.

Ten of the Grok acceptance run's 40 episodes ended like this:

    HierarchicalRootReviewCut(4 contributions)
    → HierarchicalRootReviewRejected{c-test-passes: FAIL, finding: "…"}
    → RootGoalResolutionRefused{SUCCESS_EXPRESSION_NOT_PASS, REVIEW_VERDICT_NOT_ACCEPT}
    → HierarchicalMissionStalled{hierarchical_no_dispatchable_work}
    → MissionFailed

Every leaf had been dispatched, verified and accepted; in nine of them the official
hidden grader passed the deliverable.  ``_advance_root_review`` recorded the rejection,
noted it, and returned False — the comment said "§9.1's decision table, never a silent
retry", and the decision table itself had never been implemented.  A Mission's whole
plan was decided once and a single review failure was a death sentence.

The minimal branch: a **blocking** finding reopens one Planner round per plan revision,
with the findings travelling as durable ``PlanningRejected`` feedback.
