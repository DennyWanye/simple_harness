"""P2.3c part 2b: the deployment-side ``PlanningWorld``.

P2.3b's deviation 4 and P2.3c part 2's §10 said the same thing twice: the seed
library could be *loaded* (``seed_methods.loader``) but nothing in ``src`` ever
assembled it into the object
:meth:`~...orchestrator.event_handler.EventHandler.install_hierarchical` wants —
so every hierarchical Mission outside the test suite failed at
``require_planning_world``, and a real-model smoke run could not even start.  This
module is that assembly.

What the structural type asks for and where each half comes from:

``catalog`` / ``schemas`` / ``registry`` / ``predicates``
    the four declaration stores, filled by ``install_library`` and ``admit_domain``.
    Methods go through the admission protocol rather than being registered
    directly, because §7.3's bypass is closed for seed data too.
``capabilities()``
    **not** a list in this file.  It is derived from what this deployment actually
    has: a capability is ``registered`` only when some registered *primitive* task
    type with a real ``operator_ref`` declares it, and ``configured`` only when the
    verification layer it needs is in ``deployed_layers``.  A capability a domain
    mentions and nothing implements is therefore reported unavailable *with a
    reason*, which is what the applicability report and the Planner package read.
``snapshot()``
    the evidence, read from ``htn_store``'s ``observations`` table every call.  A
    cached snapshot is the stale read ADR-13 spends a gate refusing, and the whole
    reason a refinement round can change its mind is that the round after an
    observation sees the observation.

One thing this module adds on top of the structural type, because a deployment
needs it and nothing else owns it: the **observer index** (``observation_pipeline``)
belongs to the same assembly as the predicate registry it is checked against.  A
world built without observers answers ``OBSERVER_UNAVAILABLE`` for every predicate,
which is the honest answer for a deployment that installed no reader — never FALSE.

Assigning observers is its own small problem, solved here and not in
``build_index``: the shipped ``code`` pack deliberately ships *two* identities for
``code.working-tree-clean`` (§6.6 C28 allows a CLOSED predicate several authorised
observers), while an index may hold only one reader per predicate.  Who reads what
is a deployment decision, so :func:`assign_readers` makes it one — first observer in
the given order wins the predicate, and the order is the deployment's precedence
declaration rather than an accident of the tuple ``code_observers`` returns.
