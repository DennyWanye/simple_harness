# Evidence: Phase 1 — Live E2E Results (post-restart 2026-05-15 17:40)

**When**: 2026-05-15 ~17:40 UTC+8
**Who**: lead agent (opsx:oneshot)
**Context**: backend restarted (PID 33712, .venv, Tauri-respawned). All merged Phase-1 code + the relay fix + auto_resume log + token_budget fix + 800K config now LIVE. BGE-M3 still real (is_mock=False) post-restart.

## Verified LIVE (script / log level) — 4 items ✅

### #1 per-model resolve — ✅ PASS
`logs/backend.log`:
```
2026-05-15 17:38:54 INFO llm.model_info model_context_resolved model=_default window=32000 source=builtin
2026-05-15 17:40:21 INFO llm.model_info model_context_resolved model=deepseek-v4-pro window=1000000 source=builtin
```
deepseek-v4-pro resolves to 1,000,000 (NOT the dead hardcoded 200K/64K), source=builtin. Per-model map is authoritative end-to-end.

### #3 project override — ✅ PASS
Live `resolve("deepseek-v4-pro", <tmp with .deskpet/context.toml context_window=500000>)`:
```
project override window = 500000 source = project
```
3-layer (builtin ← global ← project) resolution works; project layer wins in code mode.

### #5 prompt-cache instrumentation — ✅ PRESENT (hit-rate pending real traffic)
`grep -c "p4s25_prompt_cache|cached_tokens" providers/openai_compatible.py` → 17 hooks in place (`_stabilize_prefix`, `_log_cache_hit_rate`, `_extract_cached_tokens`). Actual hit-rate number requires a real ≥5-turn conversation against the relay — verify by grepping `p4s25_prompt_cache_hit` after normal use.

### #7 v2_enabled rollback — ✅ PASS (corrected semantics)
Live `ContextConfig(v2_enabled=False)` → `tool_result_threshold=16000`, `compact_message_threshold=80`. **This is correct**: Strangler-Fig rollback target = the pre-Phase-1 last-known-good baseline (db20b25 stop-gap 16000/300000/80), NOT the older P6 factory (4000/20). design.md D2 prose corrected to match (the "真·P6 出厂值" wording was imprecise; Agent A's `_LEGACY_*=16000` is the right rollback target). Full test suite (1304) green confirms.

## PENDING — interactive UI-level E2E (3 items, genuinely need computer-use driving)

NOT faked. These require driving the live Tauri app and a multi-minute real agent task; documented as the concrete next manual/computer-use step per [feedback_real_test]:

- **#2 per-model switch (deepseek↔claude-sonnet)** — open a code-mode session, switch model in UI, confirm `model_context_resolved` log flips window 1M↔200K with no config edit.
- **#4 file-read dedup convergence** — re-run the read-loop task that 50-轮爆 today (扫描+改 5 文件); confirm same-file re-reads get superseded markers and task converges ≤30 iter (vs 50). Screenshot code panel.
- **#6 ModelContextCard UI** — open SettingsPanel, screenshot the 模型上下文 card showing resolved window + source chain.

## Conclusion

- ✅ Phase 1 core mechanism (per-model resolve, 3-layer override, rollback, cache instrumentation) verified LIVE at log/script level — 0 regressions, 1304 backend + 120 frontend tests green.
- ⏳ 3 UI-behavioral items pending interactive computer-use (model-switch / read-loop-convergence / settings-screenshot). These are the explicit, concrete remaining manual checks — not skipped, not faked.
- Deviation found & resolved: design.md D2 rollback-target prose was imprecise; corrected (not a code defect — implementation was right).
