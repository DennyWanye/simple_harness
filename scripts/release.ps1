# W5 (R17) — packaged release helper for DeskPet (Windows).
#
# Produces NSIS installer + MSI under src-tauri\target\release\bundle\,
# then (optionally) generates the latest.json manifest that the updater
# plugin fetches.
#
# Prerequisites (one-time):
#   1. npm i -g @tauri-apps/cli (already in devDependencies, tauri CLI ok).
#   2. Rust toolchain (MSVC).
#   3. tauri signer generate -w $env:USERPROFILE\.tauri\deskpet.key
#      → copy the printed PUBLIC key into tauri.conf.json > plugins.updater.pubkey
#      → set TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY to contents of the private key file
#        (and TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD if you used a passphrase).
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh scripts\release.ps1 -Version 0.1.1
#   pwsh scripts\release.ps1 -Version 0.1.1 -NoSign        # skip signing
#
# Non-goals: this script does NOT push a GitHub release. Upload the bundle
# under assets and reference it from latest.json by hand — keeps credentials
# out of the project.
