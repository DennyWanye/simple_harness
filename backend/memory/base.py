"""MemoryStore Protocol and value objects.

V5 §4.5 envisions semantic memory (bge-m3 + sqlite vector). S2 ships
the simpler short-term conversation memory first — future slices can
add a SemanticMemoryStore alongside without changing this contract.

S14 (V5 §6 threat 5 — user agency over private data) adds a small
management surface on top of the core Protocol: listing turns with
their primary-key id, deleting a single turn, listing known sessions,
and a global ``clear_all``. These sit on the concrete class and on
any decorator (e.g. RedactingMemoryStore) rather than on the Protocol,
so a minimal backend (e.g. in-memory test double) isn't forced to
implement admin endpoints.
