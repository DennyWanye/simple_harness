"""An Assurance-lane planning round with an unknown Provider outcome is bounded.

host-final-arp10 (2026-09-24): a Planner turn of an assured Mission lost its stream after
hand-off; the lane recorded AssuranceProviderReconciliationRequired and nothing acted until
the react wall clock ~17 minutes later.  Independent adjudication: on this lane nothing is
ever re-handed off (that re-sends the original request) and reviews keep their original
executor (§6.2), but a Planner round is not a review — after the same
bound as P2.3f it ends through its own failure door, which on this lane keeps the UNKNOWN
grants and the reservation.  Reviews keep waiting (unchanged).

2026-09-26 Host run: a Worker attempt waited 35 minutes on the same kind of blocker — the
wall clock did not end it — so an assured Worker attempt now also ends after the bound,
as LOST (ordinary repair/retry), with its UNKNOWN charge and reservation kept.
