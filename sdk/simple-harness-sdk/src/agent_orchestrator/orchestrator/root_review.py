"""P2.3c part 3a: cutting the root ``MISSION_FINAL`` review, and cutting it again.

Part 2d's real-model smoke ended on one blocker and one blocker only::

    root resolution not formed: ROOT_REVIEW_PACKAGE_MISSING (no MISSION_FINAL
    ReviewPackage is stored for task task-root; the root review has not been cut,
    so there is nothing to resolve from)

``HierarchicalDispatch.root_resolution_inputs`` *reads* the three anchors a root
``GoalResolution`` is formed from — the ``MISSION_FINAL`` ``ReviewPackage``, its
official ``ReviewRecord`` and the ``purpose=ACCEPT`` witness — and reports each as
missing rather than inventing it.  Nothing in ``src`` produced them, so a
hierarchical Mission could never reach ``COMPLETED``.  This module is the deployment
side that produces them, and the whole of its design is in what it refuses to do:

* **It never writes a verdict.**  :meth:`RootReviewCoordinator.cut` freezes the
  anchor; the *conclusion* only ever arrives through
  :meth:`RootReviewCoordinator.record_review`, from a Critic reply the caller
  parsed.  AER I05 — "a review that ended is not a review that passed" — is not a
  rule this module checks, it is a shape it has: there is no code path that
  produces ``ReviewVerdict.ACCEPT`` without a reviewer having said ``PASS``.
* **It never resolves anything.**  The root resolution stays where it was
  (``attempt_root_resolution`` → ``commit_goal_resolution``), so the rule set that
  decides "is this Mission complete" is still in one place (§21.5).
* **It never re-cuts silently, and never re-cuts for ever.**  A cut is a promise
  that a reviewer saw *this* requirements revision over *these* contributions; when
  either moves the old package is superseded **with a record** and a new one is cut,
  and the number of cuts a single requirements revision may carry is bounded
  (:data:`DEFAULT_MAX_CUTS_PER_REVISION`).  Past the bound nothing is cut, a
  structured event is written, and the Mission takes part 2d's idle-stall path — a
  visible stop rather than a loop that spends a model call every cycle.

Why a re-cut is needed at all (part 2d, review P1-7).  Every leaf acceptance
publishes a Mission-level ``RequirementsRevision`` carrying *that leaf's* coverage
criteria, and the root resolution is checked against the revision its review package
was bound to.  So a leaf accepted (or revoked) after the root review was cut moves
the Mission's requirements underneath a review that never saw them, and the read-set
channel refuses the resolution with ``READ_SET_STALE``.  That refusal is correct;
the repair is to review again, which is what this module does.

The account (§13 v1.4, §21.5).  A ``MISSION_FINAL`` review's cost belongs to
``ReviewAccount.MISSION`` — :func:`~...contracts.resolution.account_for_purpose` is
the only place that mapping lives and this module quotes it rather than repeating
it.  It is deliberately **not** any Task's budget: the root review judges the
composition of every child, and charging it to whichever leaf happened to finish
last is exactly the mis-accounting §18.5 warns a new role purpose about.
