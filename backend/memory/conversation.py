"""SQLite-backed short-term conversation memory.

Uses aiosqlite for async access. Schema is append-only (no updates):
each turn is a row, `get_recent` pulls the last N ordered oldest-first
so callers can prepend them directly to the messages list.

Thread/task safety: each call opens a fresh connection — fine for the
single-process FastAPI app. If throughput becomes a concern, swap to a
connection pool; the Protocol contract won't change.

Schema is owned by ``memory.migrations/`` and applied lazily via
``memory.migrator.run_migrations`` on first use. This replaces the old
``_SCHEMA`` string constant so all DDL lives in one versioned place.
