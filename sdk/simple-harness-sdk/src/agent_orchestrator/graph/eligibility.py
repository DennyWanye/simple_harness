"""Readiness as a pure judgement, and the one gate that builds a dispatch receipt (P2.1c).

Annex TG §8 replaces "every dependency is COMPLETED" with three separate sets and
one structured verdict:

``PlanningFrontier``
    work the *planner* owes: compound tasks still to be refined, preconditions
    still to be witnessed, approvals still to be obtained.
``ExecutionFrontier``
    primitive occurrences of the currently adopted plan whose semantic
    dependencies are met — candidates, not permissions.
``AdmittedDispatch``
    what the dispatch transaction admits after re-checking identity, budget and
    physical capacity.  **Not computed here**: this module never reads a budget,
    a lease or a resource pool (plan §23, P2.1c: "不接 allocator；不调账本").

:func:`evaluate_readiness` returns one :class:`ReadinessReason` out of eleven, and
the eleven never collapse into "the task failed".  TG §8.2 is explicit that a
missing input and an unreachable observation service are different answers
needing different responses — wait for a producer, retry an observation.

Two refusals in particular are load-bearing:

* a ``form=compound`` task is intercepted by its *form*, never by a status
  string.  Plan §18.5 hard constraint 4 says the legacy ``TaskStatus.READY`` is a
  rebuildable display index and may not walk a compound into the Worker path, so
  :func:`evaluate_readiness` answers ``NEEDS_REFINEMENT`` for a compound whatever
  ``TaskView.legacy_status`` says, and :func:`legacy_ready_is_not_eligibility`
  spells the same rule out for the allocator wiring in P2.3c;
* a missing :class:`~..contracts.htn.TaskSemanticBindingV1` is ``GRAPH_INTEGRITY``.
  §18.5: a new-mode Task without a semantic binding is corruption, not a legacy
  fallback, and corruption does not silently degrade into "dispatch it anyway".

Everything here is a pure function of values the caller passes in.  There is no
store, no transaction, no model call and no ledger write; the read-set a report
carries is what makes a cached verdict checkable later (:func:`stale_after`).
