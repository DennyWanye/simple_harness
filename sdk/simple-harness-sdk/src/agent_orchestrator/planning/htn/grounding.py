"""Grounding a method against a compound task (§18.3 ``ground_method``).

Pure: type-check the bindings, derive stable identities for the slots, decide
which slots may bind an already existing goal occurrence, and return a
:class:`~agent_orchestrator.contracts.htn.MethodInstanceDraft`.  No store, no
clock, no model, no side effects — calling it twice with the same inputs returns
the same draft, byte for byte, which is what makes the occurrence identities
usable as a key.

Identity (TG §3.1, implementation design §5.2 step 3): every slot's occurrence,
task and derived obligation come from ``(instance_id, slot_key)`` and nothing
else.  Re-grounding the same method against the same goal with the same
parameters therefore lands on the same nodes, so a re-plan that keeps a slot keeps
its node rather than minting a twin.

Sharing (§8.3, TG §12): two slots bind the *same* occurrence only when the whole
sharing signature matches — goal contract, typed parameters, input versions,
authority scope, freshness, domain semantics and effect identity — *and* the task
type has declared that reuse is permitted.  Lexical closeness produces a
suggestion and never a binding, and a goal whose type writes anything is not
shared by default: two sends are two sends, whatever the parameters say.
