"""The Action Executor (plan D7-5 / D7-5'): the only caller of connectors.

It never writes the library itself.  Every state change goes through the Commit
Service: ``begin_handoff`` re-checks the approval binding, reserves the budget and writes
HANDED_OFF (the outbox) in one transaction *before* the connector is called; the call runs
in a worker thread under ``connector_timeout_seconds`` so the event loop never blocks; a
definite refusal is FAILED, anything after the hand-off that is not a matching receipt is
UNKNOWN.  UNKNOWN is never handed off blindly: ``reconcile`` asks the connector by
idempotency key and only a CONFIRMED_NOT_STARTED answer allows one more hand-off with the
*same* key (ORCH §12.1–§12.2, §12.6; SDK effects / reconciliation semantics)."""
