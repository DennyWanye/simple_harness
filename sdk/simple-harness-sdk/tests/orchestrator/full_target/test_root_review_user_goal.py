"""P2.3k / defect N2: the root reviewer is shown the user's goal, not only the template.

Grok C2-r0 (and C2-r1, C4-r0, C4-r1, identical in shape): the root review package
carried ``goal_statement = "make the named failing test pass and explain the change"``
— the goal *signature's* template sentence — and nothing the user had written.  The
Mission's goal was "让 ingest 流水线端到端跑通，坏行要留痕不要丢", its ``failing_test``
parameter pointed at ``tests/test_public_pipeline.py``, a suite that is green by
construction, and the hidden tests a Worker cannot see are where the real acceptance
lives.  So ``c-test-passes``'s evidence requirement — "the report shows the named
failing test now passes" — was unsatisfiable by any Worker, and the reviewer, reading
only the template, rejected a patch the hidden grader then passed (C2-r1, C4-r0).

The reviewer was right about what it was shown.  The fix is on what it is shown:
``RootReviewRequest`` now carries ``mission_goal`` (the Mission's goal, verbatim) and
``goal_parameters`` (the root binding's typed parameters), both inside the hashed
request so the intent's ``context_version`` covers them; and ``root-reviewer-v3`` says
that ``evidence_requirement`` is the method author's wording, to be read against
``mission_goal`` — and, when the named test was green at baseline, to ask instead for
a test covering the user's goal going red-to-green or added and passing.  The seed
wording is deliberately *not* softened (see journal §2m): on a genuine failing test
(C3) it is exactly the right requirement.
