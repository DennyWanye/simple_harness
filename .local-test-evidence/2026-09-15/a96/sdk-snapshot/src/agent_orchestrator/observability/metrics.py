"""Metrics (§23.2, theory 12-3 / 12-14, plan D6-10 / D6-11').

What can be filled from this build's records: system health (Attempt outcomes,
timeouts, backpressure transitions and the peak queue observations), cost (tokens by
role and by runtime profile; money only when the deployment is priced — otherwise
``null`` with the reason, never zero), knowledge reuse, verification pass rate, Mission
duration, and the role distribution against §29.2's starting mix (all eight §9.2 roles,
``null`` where the original gives no share)."""
