"""FULL-TARGET P2.3c part 2d, decision 4: the Worker declares its output ports.

Which of an Attempt's files is the ``repository_facts`` a downstream step asked for
is a **local key** — TG design §3.2 gives the model local keys, business goals and
parameters and binds everything else (Mission identity, accounts, scope, execution
generation) itself.  So the port↔artifact pairing is *declared* by the producer and
*checked* here, and the two old fallbacks — "the port name appears somewhere in the
path" and "one port, one artifact, so they go together" — are gone: §10.2 forbids
settling "which file is this" by name or by position.

The tests below are the parser's four structural refusals plus the template
property: the prompt asks the model for the local key and for nothing the system
binds.
